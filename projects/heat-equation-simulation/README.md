# 🔥 Heat Equation Simulation

Numerical simulation of the 1D and 2D heat equation using finite difference methods.

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Model heat flow in a rod or plate using partial differential equations (PDEs).

---

## 🧮 Math Background

- Solving the heat equation: ∂u/∂t = α ∂²u/∂x²
- Methods: Explicit Euler, Crank–Nicolson

---

## 🔢 Dataset

- Synthetic data generated via numerical methods
- Initial and boundary conditions are customizable

---

## 🛠️ Tools

- Python (NumPy, SciPy)
- matplotlib for plotting temperature evolution
- (Optional: sympy for analytical solutions)

---

## 💡 Extensions

- Simulate with non-uniform materials
- Add source terms or insulated boundaries
