# 🌌 Galaxy Morphology Classification

Using deep learning to classify galaxies into shapes like spiral, elliptical, or irregular from telescope imagery.

---

## 🔭 Objective

- Automate galaxy classification using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on real galaxy images.

---

## 🖼️ Dataset

- **Source:** [Galaxy Zoo Project](https://data.galaxyzoo.org/)
- Data: Images labeled by citizen scientists from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)

---

## 🧠 Methods

- Image preprocessing and augmentation
- CNN model training
- Transfer learning (e.g., ResNet or VGG)
- Evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix

---

## 🧰 Tools

- Python, TensorFlow/Keras
- OpenCV or Pillow
- matplotlib for visualizations

---

## 🛰️ Future Ideas

- Classify galaxy features (e.g., bars, mergers)
- Use unsupervised learning for anomaly detection
