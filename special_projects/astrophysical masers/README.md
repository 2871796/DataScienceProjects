# 🌌 Astrophysical Masers: Detection and Analysis

Astrophysical masers are powerful natural microwave emissions found in various cosmic environments. In this project, we explore the detection, classification, and analysis of maser signals using data science techniques.

## 🌠 Introduction

**Masers** (Microwave Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation) are natural analogues to lasers that emit highly amplified, narrowband microwave radiation. They occur in space under specific conditions, such as:
- **Star-forming regions**
- **Circumstellar envelopes of evolved stars**
- **Supernova remnants**
- **Galactic nuclei (hosting megamasers)**

The most commonly observed astrophysical masers arise from molecules like **water (H₂O)**, **hydroxyl (OH)**, and **methanol (CH₃OH)**. These emissions are detected primarily through **radio astronomy**, and are valuable tools for:

- **Probing the structure and dynamics** of interstellar environments  
- **Tracing magnetic fields** via Zeeman splitting  
- **Measuring distances** with very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI)  
- **Understanding galactic and extragalactic evolution**

## 🎯 Project Goals

This project aims to apply data science to radio spectral data to:

- 📈 **Detect maser signals** in noisy spectral line observations
- 🤖 **Classify maser types** based on frequency, source properties, and line shape
- 📊 **Analyze maser distributions** across galactic coordinates
- 📉 (Optional) Track **temporal variability** in maser emission over time

## 🛰️ Data Sources

- **[ATNF Maser Database](https://www.narrabri.atnf.csiro.au/databases/maserdb.html)**: Positional, spectral, and velocity information for known masers
- **Spectral data from**: ALMA, VLA, Parkes, or simulated datasets
- **Optional**: FITS files with time-domain maser monitoring data

## 🧠 Methods & Tools

- 📡 **Signal processing**: Peak detection, smoothing, FFT, and matched filtering
- 🧪 **Classification**: Supervised learning on maser features (e.g. H₂O vs. OH)
- 🌌 **Spatial analysis**: Galactic coordinate mapping, clustering
- 🕒 **Variability analysis**: Time-series modeling (e.g., Lomb-Scargle periodograms)

Libraries used:
- `pandas`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`
- `astropy`, `specutils`, `sunpy` (for FITS and spectral data)
- `scikit-learn` or `xgboost` for ML
- `seaborn`, `plotly` for visuals
